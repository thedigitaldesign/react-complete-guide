Follow the instructions explained in the problem video and try to implement a solution on your 
own. Compare it with my solution (video + downloadable files) thereafter.

The instructions are:
    1.  Add Routes to load "Users" and "Courses" on different pages (by entering a url, without Links)
    2.  Add a simple navigation with two links => One leading to "Users", on leading to "Courses"
    3.  Make the courses in "Courses" clickable by adding a link and load the "Courses" component in
        the place of "Courses" (without passing any data for now)
    4.  Pass the course ID in the "Course" page and output it there
    5.  Pass the courses title to the "Course" page - pass it as a param or score bonus points by 
        passing it as query params (you need to manually parse them though!)
    6.  Load the "Course" component as a nested component of "Courses"
    7.  Add a 404 error page and render it for any unknown routes
    8. Redirect requests to /all-courses to /courses (=> Your "Courses" page)
